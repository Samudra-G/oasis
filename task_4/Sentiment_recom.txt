Based on the analysis conducted so far, here is a short report along with recommendations:

Sentiment Analysis:

The sentiment analysis using Support Vector Machines (SVM) achieved an accuracy of 100% on a small subset of the data (first 10 rows), indicating strong performance in classifying sentiments (-1, 0, 1).
Naive Bayes, on the other hand, achieved an accuracy of approximately 58%, suggesting lower performance compared to SVM.
Feature Engineering:

Additional features such as word count, sentiment lexicons, and text readability were incorporated into the analysis.
Word count analysis revealed insights into the distribution of text lengths across different sentiment classes.
Sentiment lexicons were utilized to extract sentiment-related features, potentially enhancing the sentiment analysis model.
Text readability metrics provided insights into the ease of reading of the text, which can influence sentiment perception.
Recommendations:

Model Selection: Based on the initial results, SVM appears to be a more effective model for sentiment analysis compared to Naive Bayes. Consider further tuning and evaluation of the SVM model on the entire dataset.
Feature Importance: Explore the importance of additional features such as word count, sentiment lexicons, and text readability in improving sentiment analysis performance. Conduct feature importance analysis to identify the most influential features.
Visualization: Continue visualizing the data and analysis results to gain deeper insights and communicate findings effectively. Utilize visualizations such as bar plots and histograms to illustrate patterns and trends in the data.
Further Evaluation: Evaluate the sentiment analysis model on the entire dataset and assess its performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, consider conducting cross-validation to validate the model's robustness.
Iterative Improvement: Continuously iterate on the analysis by refining feature engineering techniques, exploring alternative models, and incorporating feedback from domain experts to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of the sentiment analysis model.
Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into sentiment classification and highlights opportunities for further optimization and refinement of the sentiment analysis model. Continued exploration and refinement of feature engineering techniques and model selection will be crucial in achieving higher accuracy and robustness in sentiment analysis.
