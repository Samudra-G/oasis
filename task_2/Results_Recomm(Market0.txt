Results:
Based on the clusters and In relationship status we can analyse further and say:

Optimal number of clusters = 4
The Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis suggested 4 clusters (k=4). The elbow method highlighted the number of 4 or 5 clusters as a reasonable number of clusters. The silhouette score analysis revealed a peak silhouette score for k=4.

Cluster Characteristics
Cluster 0: High value customers in relationship (either married or together)
This cluster represents 26% of the customer base
These customers have high income and they are in a relationship
Cluster 1: Low value single customers
This cluster represents 21% of the customer base
These customers have low income and they are single
Cluster 2: High value single customers
This cluster represents 15% of the customer base
These customers have high income and they are single
Cluster 3: Low value customers in relationship
This cluster represents 39% of the customer base
These customers have low income and they are in a relationship

Recommendations
Based on the clusters, tailored marketing strategies can be created. Customers from these segments will have different interests and product preferences.

Marketing Strategies for Each Cluster
Cluster 0: High value customers in relationship (either married or together)
Preliminary analysis showed that high income customers buy more wines and fruits.
A tailored campaign to promote high quality wines may bring good results.
This cluster contains customers in relationship, family-oriented promo-images should be quite effective for this audience.
Cluster 1: Low value single customers
Promos with discounts and coupons may bring good results for this targeted group.
Loyalty program may stimulate these customers to purchase more often.
Cluster 2: High value single customers
Similar to the Cluster 0, these customers buy a lot of wines and fruits.
This cluster contains single customers. Promo images with friends, parties or single trips may be more efficient for single customers
Cluster 3: Low value customers in relationship
This cluster has the highest percentage of our customers (39%).
Family offers and discounts may influence these customers to make more purchases
Opportunities for the further analysis
Further exploration on how children influence on the consumed products
Further analysis on the influence of education
analysis of frequent buyers
Analysis of sales channels, e.g. store, website, etc.
Analysis of the response to the marketing campaigns
It would be great to add gender data to the dataset
Test different clustering algorithms.
